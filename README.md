This UserScript removes the timeout on SourceForge downloads:

## What the script does:

- SourceForge has this intermediate page where you have to click a green "Download" button.
- The script clicks it for you
- SourceForge also has a 5 second timer, which makes you wait for your download
- The script immediately starts the download
- It then takes you back to Google, because after 5 seconds the "regular" download would open (a second time)

This script is a one-click solution, needing only one click (on the google search result) straight to the final download.
